# Number Classifier API

## Description
This API accepts a number as a query parameter and returns interesting mathematical properties about the number, including whether it's prime, perfect, Armstrong, or odd, and also provides a fun fact about the number

The API is built to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and ensures that all responses are provided in JSON format.

    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
```
